## Data-Science competition for ecological data

Scaling-up ecological patterns and processes is crucial to understanding the
effects of environmental change on natural systems and human society. We are
piloting a Data Science Challenge to help scientist do this better by using
remote sensing from low flying airplanes to infer the location and type of trees
in forests. This will allow forests to be studied in detail at regional to
global scales. 

Anyone is welcome to participate. Work as teams or
individuals. **[Sign up](register)**.

The competition is open. The deadline for submissions is December 15th, 2017.

## Data

* **Airborne remote sensing**: High resolution hyperspectral imagery, higher
resolution RGB imagery, and LiDAR data on plant height.
* **Ground Data**: Ground based measurements of tree size, location, and type
* **Individual Tree Crowns**: Ground based identification of tree crowns on
  remote sensing imagery.

## The tasks

* **Crown Delineation**: Estimate the size, shape, and location of individual tree crowns
* **Alignment**: Pair trees measured on the ground with those identified in
  remote sensing
* **Classification**: determine the species identity of each tree from remotely sensed data

* [Frequently asked questions](faq)
* Submissions are due by December 15th, 2017
* This is a pilot, so there maybe be some issues to work out along the way. We'll
  be running a full version of the challenge next year.

## About the Data Science Challenge

* Sponsored by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Data
  Science Evaluation (DSE) Series and the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundationâ€™s
  Data-Driven Discovery Initiative through grant
  [GBMF4563](https://www.moore.org/grant-detail?grantId=GBMF4563).
* Organized by the Data Science Research lab, the WEecology lab, and Stephanie
  Bohlman's lab all at the University of Florida.
* The data is collected by National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON) from
  the Ordway-Swisher Biological Station (OSBS) NEON site and by researchers at
  the University of Florida.
